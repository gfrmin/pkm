"""Unstructured producer (SPEC §7.1, §7.2).

Unstructured is the broadest and messiest of the three Phase 1
extractors: it handles the long tail of formats (``.eml``, ``.msg``,
``.pptx``, ``.xlsx``, awkward HTML) where the other two don't fit.
Per-format accuracy is lower than a specialist tool, but coverage
is the value.

Architecture choices:

  - Version check reads ``importlib.metadata.version("unstructured")``.
    We do not pin the transitive tools unstructured discovers at
    runtime (libmagic, tesseract, poppler for PDFs); pkm pins
    unstructured's own version and trusts its lower-level
    resolution. Documented because it's a real deviation from the
    exact-version discipline we apply to pandoc and docling's own
    versions.

  - Lazy import of ``unstructured.partition.auto``. The module is
    fairly heavy (NLTK, spaCy in some paths, various format
    backends), so imports are deferred to first actual use.

  - ``unstructured`` logs prolifically at INFO (model loads,
    element detection counts, heuristics). The module sets its
    logger's level to WARNING at import time so only genuine
    problems appear in pkm's JSONL event log. DEBUG and INFO
    events from unstructured are suppressed; WARNING and ERROR
    still flow through.

Config schema (strictly validated):

    {"strategy": "auto" | "fast" | "hi_res" | "ocr_only"}

Required key: ``strategy``. Unknown keys and values outside the
allowed set raise ``ProducerConfigError`` with the offender named.
The default at the config-file level is ``auto`` (resolves to
``fast`` most of the time); ``hi_res`` duplicates Docling's value
and is not recommended unless the user explicitly wants two
layout-aware extractors running on their PDFs.

Output (on success):

  - ``content`` is the JSON serialisation of the list of
    ``Element`` objects, encoded as UTF-8 bytes.
  - ``content_type`` is ``application/x-unstructured-json``.
  - ``content_encoding`` is ``utf-8``.

**Cache-purity fix:** Unstructured's default JSON includes
metadata fields that leak filesystem state — ``filename``,
``file_directory``, ``last_modified`` — making identical byte
content at different paths produce different JSON. These fields
are stripped to ``None`` before serialisation so the cached bytes
are a pure function of the input content plus config (SPEC §7.1).

Timeout: 180 s per document. Enforced with a
``ThreadPoolExecutor`` + ``future.result(timeout=...)``. On
timeout the future is abandoned (Python cannot kill a thread
running C extension code); for a short-lived CLI process the
orphaned thread dies with the process, which is tolerable.

Failure handling is broad by design: unstructured raises
non-specific ``Exception`` in various failure modes (corrupted
email, missing libmagic, format-detection disagreements), and its
error taxonomy is too unstable to pin. Any exception from the
partition call becomes ``status="failed"`` with the exception
type and message in ``error_message``.

Non-goals: no ``hi_res`` default, no chaining, no retry.
