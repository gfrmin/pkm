"""Producer-layer types (SPEC §7.1).

This module defines two types:

  - ``ProducerResult`` — a frozen dataclass describing the outcome
    of a single ``Producer.produce`` call. Consumed by
    ``pkm.cache.write_artifact``.

  - ``Producer`` — a ``typing.Protocol`` describing the shape and
    behavioural invariants a producer must satisfy. Three concrete
    producers (pandoc, docling, unstructured) land in Step 7; each
    will conform to this protocol structurally.

The protocol is ``@runtime_checkable`` so ``isinstance(p, Producer)``
gives a basic structural check. Semantic conformance (the five
behavioural invariants) is exercised in
``tests/test_producer_protocol.py`` with a positive TrivialProducer
and a negative, deliberately-broken producer per runtime-checkable
invariant.

    could not be discovered at all (``ProducerDiscoveryError`` —
    missing binary, unparseable ``--version`` output, or similar).

@runtime_checkable
class Producer(Protocol):
    """A named, versioned transformation from input bytes to an
    artifact (SPEC §2.2, §7.1).

    Identity invariants:

      - ``name`` is a stable identifier appearing in cache keys.
        Never rename in place; rename means a new producer.
      - ``version`` is the exact installed tool version (§14.5).
        Any change in behaviour MUST bump ``version``; the
        producer-version mismatch check at startup enforces that
        cache keys correspond to the running code.

    Behavioural invariants of ``produce`` (SPEC §7.1 as of v0.1.2):

      1. ``content`` is ``bytes`` on success, never ``str`` and
         never auto-decoded. Text producers encode and record the
         encoding; consumers never guess (§14.7).

      2. ``produce`` never raises. Any failure is caught internally
         and returned as ``status="failed"`` with an
         ``error_message`` (§14.3 — failures are recorded, not lost).

      3. Deterministic given the same input *content* (identified
         by ``input_hash``) and the same ``config``. ``input_path``
         is an I/O handle, not part of the determinism contract
         (two machines with identical content at different paths
         MUST produce the same output). Non-deterministic
         producers (e.g., later LLM-backed ones) must make the
         randomness source appear in ``config``.

      4. ``input_path`` is immutable from the producer's view. The
         producer MUST NOT modify it or any other filesystem state
         outside its return value (§2.1 — sources are immutable).

      5. Configuration comes only from the ``config`` argument. No
         environment variables, no home-directory files, no
         side-channel inputs (§14.6 — no hidden state).

    The protocol is a ``typing.Protocol``, not an ABC — three
    concrete producers is the gate for extracting any further
    abstraction (CLAUDE.md).
