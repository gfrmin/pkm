"""Source manifest ingestion (SPEC §8, §13.2, §13.4, §13.5).

Reads ``<root>/sources/sources.yaml``, hashes each referenced file's
byte content, and maintains the ``sources``, ``source_paths``, and
``source_tags`` tables. Directory entries with ``recursive: true``
are expanded to their contained files; symlinked subdirectories are
not traversed (loop avoidance).

Invariants:

  - A source is identified by the SHA-256 of its content (SPEC §2.1).
    Two files with byte-identical content share a single
    ``source_id`` and each path becomes a separate row in
    ``source_paths``.
  - Tags are many-to-many per §13.5 and live in ``source_tags``, one
    row per ``(source_id, tag)`` pair. On each ingest the tag set
    for a source is refreshed to exactly match ``sources.yaml`` —
    the manifest is declarative, so removing a tag from yaml
    removes it from the catalogue. The refresh is implemented as
    ``DELETE FROM source_tags WHERE source_id = ?`` followed by a
    fresh ``INSERT`` of the current set, inside the same transaction
    as any ``sources`` update.
  - ``first_seen`` is immutable once set; ``last_seen`` bumps on
    every successful observation (SPEC §8.2 explicitly requires
    this). Idempotency is therefore framed in terms of row counts:
    a second run adds no new ``sources`` and no new ``source_paths``
    rows, and the net ``source_tags`` set is unchanged.
  - Unreadable entries produce a WARNING and are skipped (§13.4).
    Ingest never halts on a bad manifest entry; subsequent entries
    are processed normally.

Manifest-level problems (file missing, malformed YAML, unsupported
version, non-mapping top-level) raise ``IngestError`` — these are
"fix the yaml" conditions, distinct from per-entry skippable ones.
