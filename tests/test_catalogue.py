"""Contract tests for ``pkm.catalogue``.

These tests pin the migration runner's behaviour before the module
exists. They establish:

- A fresh root migrates cleanly to schema v1 (SPEC §5.1).
- Running migrations twice is a proven no-op (SPEC §6.1 idempotency,
  generalised to schema state).
- Editing an applied migration after the fact is detected and
  rejected loudly (SPEC §14.8 migration hash verification).
- Deleting an applied migration file is detected and rejected loudly
  (same paragraph).

Also exercises the default ``migrations_dir`` path (via the production
module) so the tests cover what ``pkm migrate`` will actually do, not
only a synthetic in-tmp copy.
